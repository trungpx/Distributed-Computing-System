# Distributed-Computing-System
Implement the algorithms: RMI, RPC, CORBA, MPI,...
## An example application using RMI scheme for movie online ticket booking system.
The customer side can: Search, order the tickets, do the payment, perform bank transfer. Further more, they can also chat via a chat room. The RMI wrote in the java language with NetBean IDE 8.2. From my point of view, after using the InteliJ to do the same project, it is not flexible for interface design and the function for graphic designing is so limited. So, I strongly recommend you to use the NetBean for the Java project (very powerful IDE).
